## Countdown Redirect Snippet

This code snippet provides a simple yet effective countdown timer with automatic redirection functionality. It's designed to be easily integrated into existing web projects where you might want to delay a redirect.

**Features**

- **Visual Countdown:** Displays a numerical countdown indicating remaining seconds.
- **Loading Animation:** Includes a simple spinning loader to provide visual feedback.
- **Automatic Redirection:** Redirects the user to a specified URL when the countdown reaches zero.
- **Customizable:** Adjust countdown time, loader styles, and the redirect URL.

**How to Use**

1. **Include Files:**

   - **Copy the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into your project files.** You'll likely have a main HTML file, an external CSS file, and an external JavaScript file.
   - **Ensure the file paths in the `<link>` and `<script>` tags within your HTML file are correct** relative to your project's structure. For example:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles/style.css" />
   <script src="scripts/script.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Add the HTML Structure:**

   - **Place the following HTML code snippet within the `<body>` section of your HTML file** where you want the countdown and redirect message to appear:

   ```html
   <div id="redirect-message">
     <div class="loader-container">
       <p>Redirecting to home in <span id="countdown">5</span> seconds...</p>
       <div class="loader"></div>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

3. **Customize (Optional):**

   - **Countdown Time:** In the `script.js` file, modify the initial value of the `countdown` variable to control the starting time of the countdown.
   - **Loader Styles:** Adjust the CSS within the `style.css` file to change the appearance of the loader (size, colors, animation).
   - **Redirect URL:** Within the `script.js` file, replace `"https://www.your-home-page.com"` with the actual URL you want users to be redirected to.

**Explanation**

- **HTML:** The HTML sets up the basic container, a message with a countdown placeholder, and a div for the loader.
- **CSS:** The CSS provides styling for the text, the loader container, and creates the spinning animation effect of the loader.
- **JavaScript:** The JavaScript handles the logic:
  - It gets a reference to the countdown element in the HTML.
  - Defines a function to decrement the countdown and update the display.
  - Uses `setInterval` to repeatedly call the update function every second.
  - When the countdown reaches zero, it clears the interval and uses `window.location.href` to redirect the user.
